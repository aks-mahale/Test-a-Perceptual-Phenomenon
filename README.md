# Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomenon

Description
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.


Statistical techniques using Python to investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology known as the Stroop Effect. Python code was used to produce descriptive statistics, data visualizations and run a paired samples t-test

Recorded response times for participants to identify words which are congruent or incongruent.
